      Choose Node.js package manager to use. Supports npm and pnpm.
      The package manager must follow the format <name>[@<version|tag>].
      Omitting the version implies that the npm version is determined by the target Node.js environment,
      while pnpm will default to the latest version.

steps:
  - run:
      name: Check Node.js version
      command: <<include(scripts/check-node-version.sh)>>
  - run:
      name: Ensure package manager
      environment:
        PKG_MANAGER: <<parameters.ref>>
      command: <<include(scripts/ensure-pkg-manager.sh)>>
